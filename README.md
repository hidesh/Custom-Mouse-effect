# Custom-mouse-effect üñ±Ô∏è
Hi! üëã
Welcome to Custom-mouse-effect, a project created for my exam focused on learning and working with npm to create reusable React components. This package offers two customizable cursor effects: FollowingCircle and CustomCursorParticles, designed to simplify styling and enhance user interaction.

## Components:

### FollowingCircle
A cursor effect that creates a trail of circles following the mouse pointer, with customizable primary and secondary colors, and the number of circles.
