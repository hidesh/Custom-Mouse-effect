# Custom-Mouse-effect üñ±Ô∏è
Hi! üëã
Welcome to custom-mouse-effect, a project created for my exam focused on learning and working with npm to create reusable React components. This package offers two customizable cursor effects: FollowingCircle and CustomCursorParticles, designed to simplify styling and enhance user interaction.

## Components:

### FollowingCircle
A cursor effect that creates a trail of circles following the mouse pointer, with customizable primary and secondary colors, and the number of circles.

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <FollowingCircle primaryColor="blue" secondaryColor="green" numCircles={15} /> // Properties that you can change, out of your taste.
      <CustomCursorParticles particleColor="255, 0, 0" radius={2} /> // Properties that you can change, out of your taste.
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
